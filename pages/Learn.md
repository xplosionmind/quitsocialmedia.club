Before taking action, you should learn the most you can about Social Media, and you should [grasp the purpose](/why) of quitting.

The first and main thing to do is always the same: study study study  **s t u d y**.

I didn't get to the conclusion of deleting social media all by myself: I started by watching some videos, then I read some books, and I keep myself informed all the time by reading articles and trying to understand how social media work. Actually, to be more independent from social media, you have to **learn** everything you can about them: How do they work? Who are they owned by? What are their effects on people? How do they transform our global society? Which researches have been made, what are their results? There are infinitely many questions to answer to, and attempting to answer to one of them means triggering the need to answer to **all of them**. When you're finished asking yourself questions, ask yourself one more: “is it enough?”.

The most important action to take is to **become aware** of the entity we're dealing with. The bigger problem about the proliferation of [misinformation](/why#misinformation) and psychological issues due to social media use is that **we know** our interactions are used to profile us, we know we're getting addicted, we know that too much of it is harmful, but we stop there, we don't dive deeper.

Start by diving deeper.
